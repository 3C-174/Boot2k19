## Storyboard (Round 2)

Experiment 1: Tower of Hanoi
### 1. Story Outline:
The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical game or puzzle. It consists of three rods, and a number of disks of different sizes which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape. The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules: 
• Only one disk can be moved at a time. 
• Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of nother stack i.e. a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack.
 • No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk. With three disks, the puzzle can be solved in seven moves.
The minimum number of moves required to solve a Tower of Hanoi puzzle is 2^n - 1, where n is the number of disks.

The objective of the experiment is to understand and code the problem of Tower of Hanoi using recursion for n disks.
### 2. Story:
Understand and code the problem of Tower of Hanoi using recursion for n disks.
We have made two games:A tower made of 3 disks and another of 7 disks.The student has to try and observe the pattern he follows while solving the puzzle.The student is then suppossed to proceed to the Code tab in order to know about the concepts behind the solution to the Puzzle.Quiz section is for checking the concepts of student.

 1.	Recursion: The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function. Using recursive algorithm, certain problems can be solved quite easily. Examples of such problems are Towers of Hanoi (TOH)
Recursion is useful in solving problems which can be broken down into smaller problems of the same kind.

2.	Minimum number of moves: The minimum number of moves required to solve a Tower of Hanoi puzzle is 2^n - 1, where n is the number of disks.
