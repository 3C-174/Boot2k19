#### 5. Task & Assessment Questions:

Complete the following table with details of the various tasks and assessment questions you will give to the students.

| **Sr.No.** | **Learning Objective to be met**(choose anyone from you declared above)             | **Tasks to be performed by the students**   | **Assessment questions aligned to the task**                |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1**      | Student will be able to recall the concept of Stack using Recursion.                | Animation of stack seen by student.         | How to perform push and pop operation on to the stack.      |
| **2**      | Student will be able to describe the concept of Tower of Hanoi.                     | Three disk puzzle (Move one disk at a time) | How many moves are required for a three disk puzzle?        |
| **3**      | Student will implement the concept of Tower of Hanoi using Animation.               | Smaller disk place on the larger disk.      | Can the larger disk place on the smaller disk? (True/False) |
| **4**      | Student will be able to analyze the concept of Stack, Recursion and Tower of Hanoi. | Smaller disk place on the larger disk.  | Can we perform Tower of Hanoi without recursion?            |



#### 6. Simulator Interactions:

**Complete the following table giving the details of the Simulator interactions.**

| **Sr. No.** | **What students will do?**                  | **What simulator will do?**                                                                                                     | **Purpose of the task**                                                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1**       | Student will land in simulator              | Simulator lorded with three rods with one rod congaing three disks. Simulator also has a button to change the play seven disks. | Understand the Tower of Hanoi                                           |
| **2**       | Student will click on play with 3 disks tab | Simulator will let the student solve the puzzle for 3 disks                                                                     | This will make the student observe the pattern for solving the puzzle.  |
| **3**       | Student will click on play with 7 disks tab | Simulator will let the student solve the puzzle for 7 disks                                                                     | This will make the student understand about the algorithm more clearly. |
| **4**       | Click drag and drop button on the simulator | Simulator show drag and drop button                                                                                             | To assess the concept of Tower of Hanoi                                 |
