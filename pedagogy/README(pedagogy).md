#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What students will do? | What Simulator will do ? | Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| Student will click on Play with 3 disks tab | Simulator will let the student solve the puzzle for 3 disks| This will make the student observe the pattern for solving the puzzle.
2.| Student will click on Play with 7 disks tab | Simulator will let the student solve the puzzle for 7 disks| This will make the student think about the algorithm more clearly.
