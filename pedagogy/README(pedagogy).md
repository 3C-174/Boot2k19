| ----------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1**       | Student will land in simulator              | Simulator lorded with three rods with one rod congaing three disks. Simulator also has a button to change the play seven disks. | Understand the Tower of Hanoi                                           |
| **2**       | Student will click on play with 3 disks tab | Simulator will let the student solve the puzzle for 3 disks                                                                     | This will make the student observe the pattern for solving the puzzle.  |
| **3**       | Student will click on play with 7 disks tab | Simulator will let the student solve the puzzle for 7 disks                                                                     | This will make the student understand about the algorithm more clearly. |
